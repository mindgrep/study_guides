## Dynamics

Studies "Why" objects move

### Newton's laws of motion

#### First law - "law of intertia"

Every object maintains its state of "rest" or "uniform motion"
unless acted on by an external, unbalanced force.

rest and uniform motion imply:
* velocity is constant (uniform motion) or zero (rest).
* acceleration (a) = 0.
rest is just a "special case" of uniform motion.

"mass is a 'proxy' for inertia"

#### Second law - "Force" 

Acceleration is proportional to the "net" force (also called "resultant" force)

F = m * a (mass x acceleration)

So from first law, if a = 0, F = 0. (rest/uniform motion means no unbalanced force)

Units of force: 

(mass) * (acceleration) = $(Kg) * (m/s^2)$

Also called "Newtons" : $1 N = 1 Kg-m/s^2$

#### Third law - "Action and Reaction"

To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

If object A exerts force X on B (action), the object B exerts the same force X on A (reaction).

### Weight

Mass != Weight

Weight is a Force - the force of gravity exerted by the Earth on a body.

$F_{w} = mg$ or $F_{g} = mg$

### Normal force

Force exerted by a surface on a body resting on the surface, in a direction perpendicular to the surface.

### Overall strategy for dynamics problems

* Visualize / sketch - draw force diagrams to figure out "resultant" force
  * Use arrows to show directions of forces
  * Use length of the arrows to represent magnitude of the forces
  * Don't confuse other vector quantities (like velocity / displacement) in a force (also called free-body) diagram
* Clearly define and use a coordinate system (cartesian, 2D, usually)
  * "resolve" forces along the (2) (x,y) axes

### Friction

When a body is in contact with a surface, the component of the contact force that is *parallel* to the surface is friction.
(unlik "normal" force)
underlying (molecular level) mechanism of friction - electrostatic interactions between atoms of object and surface

Two types of friction:
* Static - higher than kinetic - occurs when there is no relative motion between body and surface
* Kinetic (sliding) - occurs when there is relative motion between body and surface

Coefficient of friction - denoted by the symbol $mu$. It has no units.
* Coefficient of *static* friction - $\mu_{s}$
* Coefficient of *kinetic* friction - $\mu_{k}$
$\mu_{s} > \mu_{k}$
