# Shriya AP Physics study guide - Momentum

What happens when objects interact with each other - basically when they "collide"

* The symbol for momentum is **p**
* Momentum is defined as **p** = *m***v**
* From Newton's second law of motion, we get F = $\frac{{\Delta}p}{{\Delta}t} = m\frac{{\Delta}v}{{\Delta}t}$ = ma
* Momentum is a *vector* (because velocity is a vector)

## Impulse

* Product of force and the time during which it acts
* Formula for Impulse: J = F${\Delta}t$
* Another way to calculate impulse (often the simpler way): J = ${\Delta}p$ - also called the "Impulse-Momentum theorem" (very useful in problems)
* Given a graph of F vs t, the impulse is the area under the curve for the given time period (remember this for problems)
* Units of impulse - Kg-m/s
* Average force F = J * ${\Delta}t$

## Pitfalls in problems

* Pay attention to units - especially time! sometimes time is given in ms (milliseconds) - you will need to concvert this to seconds to get the final answer (in SI units), by dividing the time in milliseconds by 1000.

## Notes for AP physics exam

* You will not be expected to calculate area under curves using calculus. You can assume basic geometric shapes to calculate area (trapezoid / rectangle).
* Remember - area of trapezoid = $\frac{1}{2}(base_1 + base_2)* height$

## Conservation of linear momentum

The total linear momentum of an isolated (or closed) system remains constant

* This follows from:
  * Newton's 2nd law (F = $\frac{{\Delta}p}{{\Delta}t}$ AND
  * Newton's 3rd law (equal and opposite forces between objects)
  * Because - when 2 objects collide, the momentum change in one object is equal and opposite to that in the other one

* total $p_{initial}$ = total $p_{final}$
* Examples of problems:
  * Two objects collide - sum of initial momentums equals sum of final momentums (momenta?)
  * A person throws an object they had in their possession - initial velocities are both 0, therefore initial momentums as well. Final momentums of the person and the object will be equal and opposite (same magnitude, opposite direction).

## Collisions

Total linear momentum is conserved during a collision, eventho the objects' momenta may individually change (i.e. they exert (equal and opposite) forces on each other).

* Types of collisions
  * Elastic: both KE and momentum are conserved, objects bounce off each other in opposite directions. $m1v1 + m2v2 = m1v3 + m2v4$
  * Inelastic: KE is lost, but momentum is conserved, objects travel in the same direction after collision. $m1v1 + m2v2 = m1v3 + m2v4$
  * Perfectly inelastic $m1v1 + m2v2 = (m1 + m2)v3$
    * Also known as completely inelastic or totally inelastic collision
    * Greatest KE is lost, but momentum is conserved. Objects stick to each other after collision.
  * In inelastic collisions, the KE lost is converted into heat, and the objects would be warmer after the impact as a result.

## Pitfalls in problems

* **VERY IMPORTANT!!** Pay attention to the *sign* (direction) of the velocities of the 2 objects.
  * If they are initially moving towards each other, the velocity of one will be positive and the other will be negative.
  * This **will** affect the total momentum calculation.
* Problems may ask you to figure out whether a collision is elastic, inelastic or totally inelastic.
  * To figure this out, calculate the total initial KE and the total final KE.
  * If the final KE = initial KE, it's elastic. Otherwise it's inelastic.
  * And if they are moving together (stuck) with the same velocity, it's perfectly inelastic.
  * If the initial KE < final KE, you have an error in your calculation!! (likely because you got the sign of a velocity wrong)
