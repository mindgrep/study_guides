# Two ways to solve

A ball is thrown up at a speed of 8 $m/s^2$.
It takes 3 seconds to go up, come down and hit the ground.
Calculate the height from which the ball was thrown.

## So if you solve it like this (which is what the text did):

use $s = ut - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$  
$\therefore s = 8*3 - 0.5 * 10 * 3^2 = 21 m$  

## But if you solve it like I did:

### step 1: compute time taken to reach peak height

v = u + at  
or  
0 = u - gt  
t = $\frac{u}{g}$  
t = $\frac{8}{10}$ = 0.8  

### step 2: compute distance covered from peak height to ground

time remaining = 3 sec - 0.8 = 2.2 sec  
s = ut - $\frac{1}{2}gt^2$  
s = 0 - 0.5 * 10 * $(2.2)^2$  
$\therefore$ s = - 24.2 m

### step 3: compute distance from initial position to peak

s = ut - $\frac{1}{2}gt^2$  
s = 8 * 0.8 - 0.5 * 10 * (0.8)(0.8)  
s = 3.2 m

## step 4: subtract distances in step 3 from step 4 to get distance from initial position to the ground

s = 24.2 - 3.2 = 21 m

So we get the same solution.
